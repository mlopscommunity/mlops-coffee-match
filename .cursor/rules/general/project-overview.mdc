# MLOps Coffee Match Project Rules

## Project Context
This is an AI-powered recommendation system for matching MLOps community members for virtual coffee 1:1s. The system uses synthetic data to preserve privacy while building a scalable matching algorithm.

## Core Principles
- **Privacy First**: Use synthetic data, never real participant information
- **Fairness**: Ensure broad coverage and prevent popular profiles from dominating
- **Quality**: Generate meaningful matches with clear justifications
- **Scalability**: Design for growth from 80-100+ participants per round

## Key Components
- **Synthetic Generation**: Create realistic but anonymized participant data
- **Feature Engineering**: Build embeddings for profile and preference matching
- **Matching Algorithm**: Agent-based system with LLM reasoning
- **Optimization**: Post-match review and re-assignment for quality

## Data Flow
1. Real data → Synthetic generation → Feature engineering
2. Embedding creation → Similarity scoring → Matching
3. Quality review → Optimization → Final assignments

## Architecture Overview
- **matching/**: Core matching logic and data models
- **synthetic_generation/**: Data generation and LLM integration
- **data/**: Synthetic datasets only (never real participant data)
- **tests/**: Comprehensive test coverage

## Technology Stack
- **Python 3.12+** with uv for dependency management
- **Pydantic** for data validation and models
- **OpenAI API** for embeddings and LLM reasoning
- **Pandas** for data processing
- **Typer** for CLI interfaces
- **Rich** for enhanced terminal output

## Critical Constraints
- Never commit real participant data to version control
- Always exclude PII fields from LLM processing
- Use consistent model versions across the project
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Design for testability and maintainability
